# Customer-churn-ML
The dataset is related to a telecommunication provider and its customers. The customers leaving this provider aka "churn rate" is high and hence the provider wants to predict which of its customers would leave the provider in future.  The objective is to predict whether a customer will change telecommunications provider or not.
